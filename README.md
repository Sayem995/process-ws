Plan:
# i work for a company that makes digital audio plugins
# Apply filters to change how the track sounds
# Write a band pass filter


# Filters- Takes in a sound wave and outputs a modified sound wave
# it takes in an array of frequencies
# Lower and upper limit for the soundwave
# Default values: Upper - 1000 / Lower - 40
# use these limits to prevent the frequencies outside the range
# if its lower than the lower limit, return lower limit
# if its above the upper limit, return upper limit
# input value - the value that is the modified sound wave
